### Data Layer Documentation

#### 1. Data Source
The `WeatherDataSource` is responsible for fetching weather data from an external API (Weather API). It provides an abstract class (`WeatherDataSource`)
with a method to fetch the weather information (`fetchWeatherInfo`), which takes longitude and latitude as inputs.

- WeatherDataSourceImpl: Implements the data source. Uses the `http` client to make a GET request to the Weather API, parsing the response into a `WeatherModel`.
- Error Handling: It handles various exceptions like `SocketException`, `TimeoutException`, `http.ClientException`,
 and other unknown errors by throwing a `NetworkException`.

#### 2. Model
The `WeatherModel` and its nested models represent the structure of the weather data retrieved from the API.
 Each model has methods to convert from and to JSON, and methods to convert the model to its respective entity.

- WeatherModel: Contains data about the current weather, forecast, and location.
- Location: Represents the location details (name, region, and country).
- CurrentWeatherModel: Contains current weather conditions like temperature, humidity, UV index, and wind speed.
- ForecastWeatherModel: Represents the weather forecast, containing a list of forecast days.
- ForecastDayModeL: Represents weather details for a specific day.
- DayModel: Contains temperature, chance of rain, wind speed, and humidity for a specific day.
- AstroModel: Represents sunrise and sunset times.
- ConditionModel: Contains the weather condition text and icon.

Each model has a `toEntity()` method, which converts it to its corresponding domain layer entity.

#### 3. Repository Implementation
The `WeatherRepoImpl` class implements the domain layer's `WeatherRepo` interface.
It uses the `WeatherDataSource` to fetch the weather data and convert it to an entity.

- Error Handling: If a `NetworkException` is thrown, the repository returns a `Failure` object containing the error message.
